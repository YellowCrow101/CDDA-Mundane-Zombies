# Cataclysm-DDA
My mod(s) for Cataclysm
This mod was created by "TheUndyingCode" years ago, back in the 0.C days. I've been using it forever, however over the years more mobs have been added (and removed) and
it has fallen woefully out of date. Thus, I decided to pick up where he left of, and edit it for the newer/newest versions of the game.

TO INSTALL:
Simply take the MUNDANE_ZOMBIES [NEW] folder, and drop it in your mods folder located at Cataclysm->Data->Mods.

After dropping it in the mod folder, edit the name and remove "[NEW]" for the best possible results with the mod.

In the creation of a new world, the mod will show up under "Blacklist".

For the best results (but not strictly necessary), turn your world's monster evolution down to "0.00".

Be aware that the old version either won't work at all on newer versions, or there will be errors with it.
